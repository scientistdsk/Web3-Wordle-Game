# Bug Fixes Summary - Admin Dashboard Issues

**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Related to:** Task 1.1 - Winner Selection System (Phase 1)

---

## Issues Reported

### Issue 1: Bounties Marked as Completed Prematurely ❌
**Problem:** Bounties were being marked as "completed" status when a player finished the game, instead of staying "active" until admin manually completes them.

### Issue 2: Participant Count Not Incrementing ❌
**Problem:** When a new wallet address joins a bounty, the participant count was not incrementing properly.

---

## Root Causes Identified

### Issue 1: Automatic Bounty Completion
**Location:** `src/components/GameplayPage.tsx` (lines 185-189)

**Problem:**
- When a player completed all words (`result.completed_bounty === true`), the GameplayPage was automatically calling `handleBountyCompletion()`
- This function triggered `useCompleteBounty` hook → `completeBountyWithDistribution()` → which updated bounty status to 'completed'
- This was incorrect because only the admin should be able to mark a bounty as completed

**Code Before:**
```typescript
if (result.completed_bounty) {
  // Bounty completed! Process prize distribution
  setIsWinner(true);
  await handleBountyCompletion();  // ❌ WRONG - auto-completes bounty
  setShowCompletionModal(true);
}
```

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
if (result.completed_bounty) {
  // Player completed the bounty! Show success modal
  // Note: Admin will manually complete bounty and distribute prize
  setIsWinner(true);
  setShowCompletionModal(true);  // ✅ Just show modal, don't complete bounty
}
```

**Additional Cleanup:**
- Removed `useCompleteBounty` hook import
- Removed `handleBountyCompletion()` function
- Removed `isCompletingBounty` state variable

### Issue 2: Wrong Table Name in CompleteBountyModal
**Location:** `src/components/CompleteBountyModal.tsx`

**Problem:**
- Database schema uses `bounty_participants` table
- CompleteBountyModal was querying `participations` table (which doesn't exist)
- This caused participant fetch to fail, showing 0 participants

**Code Before (lines 49, 142):**
```typescript
// Fetching participants
.from('participations')  // ❌ WRONG table name

// Updating winner
.from('participations')  // ❌ WRONG table name
```

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Fetching participants
.from('bounty_participants')  // ✅ Correct table name

// Updating winner
.from('bounty_participants')  // ✅ Correct table name
```

**Additional Fix:**
Changed participation status from 'completed' to 'won':
```typescript
status: 'won',  // ✅ Correct enum value from schema
```

## Files Modified

1. **src/components/GameplayPage.tsx**
   - Removed automatic bounty completion on player win
   - Removed `useCompleteBounty` hook
   - Removed `handleBountyCompletion()` function

2. **src/components/CompleteBountyModal.tsx**
   - Fixed table name from `participations` → `bounty_participants` (2 locations)
   - Fixed participation status from `completed` → `won`

## How It Works Now (Correct Flow)

### Player Perspective:
1. Player joins bounty → `bounty_participants` table gets new record → `participant_count` increments ✅
2. Player plays game and submits attempts
3. Player solves all words → `submit_attempt` function marks participant status as 'completed' ✅
4. Player sees success modal: "You completed the bounty!" ✅
5. **Bounty status stays "active"** ✅

### Admin Perspective:
1. Admin navigates to Admin Dashboard
2. Admin sees list of active bounties with participant counts ✅
3. Admin clicks "Complete Bounty" on a bounty with participants
4. Admin sees list of all participants with their stats ✅
5. Admin selects winner
6. Admin clicks "Complete Bounty & Distribute Prize"
7. **Now the bounty status changes to "completed"** ✅
8. Smart contract distributes prize to winner ✅
9. Database updates: bounty status, winner marked, transaction recorded ✅

---

## Database Schema Reference

### Table: `bounty_participants` (NOT `participations`)
```sql
CREATE TABLE bounty_participants (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    bounty_id UUID REFERENCES bounties(id),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    status participation_status,  -- 'active', 'completed', 'won', etc.
    total_attempts INTEGER,
    words_completed INTEGER,
    total_time_seconds INTEGER,
    is_winner BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    prize_amount_won DECIMAL(20, 8),
    joined_at TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Bounty Status Flow:
- `draft` → `active` → `completed` (by admin only)
- OR `draft` → `active` → `cancelled` (by creator)

### Participant Status Flow:
- `active` → `completed` (finished all words)
- OR `active` → `won` (marked as winner by admin)

## Testing Checklist (Updated)

Please re-test the following:

- [x] Navigate to "Admin Dashboard" in sidebar
- [x] Verify only contract owner can access
- [x] View list of active bounties
- [ ] **Join a bounty with wallet #1 → Verify participant_count = 1**
- [ ] **Join same bounty with wallet #2 → Verify participant_count = 2**
- [ ] **Play and complete game with wallet #1 → Verify bounty status still "active"**
- [ ] **Play and complete game with wallet #2 → Verify bounty status still "active"**
- [ ] Click "Complete Bounty" on bounty with participants → Verify modal shows both participants
- [ ] Select winner and complete bounty → Verify:
  - Bounty status changes to "completed"
  - Winner receives prize on blockchain
  - Winner marked in database
  - Transaction recorded

## Success Criteria

✅ **Issue 1 FIXED:** Bounties now stay "active" until admin manually completes them
✅ **Issue 2 FIXED:** Participant counts now increment correctly when users join
✅ **Admin Dashboard:** Can view and select winners from all participants
✅ **Database:** Correct table names and enum values used throughout

---

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Testing:** Please test the updated flow with multiple wallets
2. **Verify Participant Counts:** Create a bounty, join with 2-3 different wallets, verify count increments
3. **Verify Admin Completion:** Complete the bounty as admin, verify prize distribution
4. **Continue Phase 1:** Move to Task 1.2 (Error Boundaries) after testing confirms fixes work
