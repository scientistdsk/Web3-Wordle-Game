**Step 1: Environment Setup**
1. Create production `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   VITE_HEDERA_NETWORK=mainnet
   VITE_HEDERA_MAINNET_RPC=https://mainnet.hashio.io/api
   VITE_REOWN_PROJECT_ID=<production_project_id>
   # VITE_ESCROW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS will be set after deployment
   ```

   - [ ] Create new project (production)
   - [ ] Run all migrations
   - [ ] Configure RLS policies
   - [ ] Setup backups (daily)
   - [ ] Configure alerts
   - [ ] Test database connectivity

3. Update smart contract deployment `.env`:

   HEDERA_MAINNET_OPERATOR_KEY=0xabc...
   HEDERA_MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.hashio.io/api
   ```

**Step 2: Get Mainnet HBAR**
- [ ] Purchase HBAR from exchange (Binance, Coinbase, etc.)
- [ ] Transfer to deployment wallet (ECDSA account)
- [ ] Verify balance (need ~50 HBAR for deployment + fees)

**Step 3: Smart Contract Deployment**
```bash
# Final test on testnet one more time
pnpm run deploy:testnet

# If successful, deploy to mainnet
pnpm run deploy:mainnet
```

Expected output:
```
Deploying WordleBountyEscrow to Hedera Mainnet...
✅ Contract deployed at: 0x...
✅ Transaction hash: 0x...
✅ Owner: 0.0.xxxxx
✅ Platform fee: 250 (2.5%)
✅ Gas used: ~800,000

⚠️ SAVE THIS CONTRACT ADDRESS! ⚠️
```

**Step 4: Contract Verification**
```bash
# Verify on HashScan
pnpm run verify:mainnet

# Manual verification (if automated fails)
# 1. Go to https://hashscan.io/mainnet/contract/0x...
# 2. Click "Contract" tab
# 3. Click "Verify Contract"
# 4. Upload source code + constructor args
```

**Step 5: Update Frontend**
1. Update `.env.local` with deployed contract address
2. Update `vite.config.ts` for production build
3. Build production bundle:
   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   ```
4. Test production build locally:
