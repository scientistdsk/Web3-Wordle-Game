## 💡 Pro Tips

### Development Best Practices
1. **Test incrementally** - Don't implement everything at once
2. **Update docs** - Keep COMPLETION_STATUS.md current
3. **Commit often** - Small, focused commits
4. **Review code** - Check your work before moving on
5. **Ask questions** - Better to clarify than assume

### Using the Prompts
Each phase file has a detailed prompt at the bottom:
- Read the entire task description first
- Copy the prompt exactly
- Add any specific requirements
- Start with Task #1 in each phase
- Test thoroughly before next task

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Skipping Phase 1 (fixes critical blockers)
- ❌ Skipping Phase 2 testing (finds bugs early)
- ❌ Rushing to mainnet (security risks)
- ❌ Not updating documentation
- ❌ Implementing features out of order

### Timeline Management
- **Week 1:** Phase 1 (critical fixes)
- **Weeks 2-3:** Phase 2 (testing & polish)
- **Weeks 4-5:** Phase 3 (advanced features)
- **Week 6:** Phase 4 (production launch)
- **Buffer:** +1-2 weeks for unexpected issues

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Where do I start?"
→ Read [RECOMMENDATIONS_SUMMARY.md](./RECOMMENDATIONS_SUMMARY.md)

### "What's most critical?"
→ Phase 1, Task 1.1 (Winner Selection System)

### "Can I skip testing?"
→ Not recommended. Phase 2 prevents production bugs.

→ 2 weeks for minimal viable (Phase 1 only)

### "Do I need all features?"
→ Phase 1-2: Must-have
→ Phase 3: Highly recommended
→ Phase 4: Required for mainnet

### "Help! I'm stuck on a task"
→ Review the task description carefully
→ Check existing code for similar patterns
→ Ask specific questions with context
