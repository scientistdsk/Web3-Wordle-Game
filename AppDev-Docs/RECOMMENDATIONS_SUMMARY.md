## 🔑 Key Decisions Needed

### Decision 1: Winner Selection Approach (Choose before Phase 1)

**Option A: Admin Dashboard (Recommended for Phase 1)**
- ✅ Quick to implement (3-5 days)
- ✅ No infrastructure needed
- ❌ Manual work required
- ❌ Not scalable
- **Use Case:** Beta testing, early launch

**Option B: Automated Oracle (Recommended for Phase 3)**
- ✅ Fully automated
- ✅ Scalable
- ❌ Requires backend service
- ❌ More complex (4-5 days)
- **Use Case:** Production at scale

**Recommendation:** Start with Option A in Phase 1, upgrade to Option B in Phase 3.

---

### Decision 2: Timeline Preference

**Option 1: Fast Track (Minimum Viable)**
- 2 weeks (Phase 1 only)
- Admin dashboard for winner selection
- Basic error handling
- Testnet deployment
- Manual processes
- **Best for:** Hackathon deadline, quick beta

**Option 2: Balanced (Recommended)**
- 6 weeks (All phases)
- Automated oracle service
- Full testing suite

- **Best for:** Production-ready launch

**Option 3: Comprehensive**
- 8-10 weeks (All phases + extras)
- All advanced features
- Multi-language support
- Social integrations
- Marketing materials
- **Best for:** Long-term product

**Recommendation:** Option 2 (Balanced) for quality production launch.

---

### Decision 3: Technology Stack for Oracle

**Option A: Node.js Service**
- Familiar technology
- Easy to deploy (Railway, Render, Fly.io)
- Full control
- Runs 24/7

**Option B: Supabase Edge Functions**
- Serverless (no infrastructure)
- Auto-scaling
- Built into existing stack
- Limited to 60s execution time

**Recommendation:** Option A (Node.js) for reliability and flexibility.

## 🤝 Support & Questions

If you have questions while implementing:

1. **Check the documentation** - Most answers are in the phase files
2. **Review existing code** - Look at similar implementations
3. **Test incrementally** - Don't implement everything at once
4. **Ask for clarification** - Better to ask than assume

**Common Questions:**

**Q: Should I implement all features at once?**
A: No! Follow phases sequentially. Each builds on the previous.

**Q: Can I skip testing (Phase 2)?**
A: Not recommended. Testing prevents production bugs that are expensive to fix.

**Q: Do I need the oracle service?**
A: Eventually, yes. Start with admin dashboard (Phase 1), add oracle in Phase 3.

**Q: How long will this really take?**
A: For one developer: 6-8 weeks. With a team: 4-6 weeks. Minimum viable: 2 weeks.
