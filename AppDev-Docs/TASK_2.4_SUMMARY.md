- ✅ Platform fees collected
- ✅ Average bounty size calculation
- ✅ Most popular bounty type
- ✅ Completion rate progress bar
- ✅ Cancellation rate progress bar
- ✅ Color-coded stat cards with icons
- ✅ Hover animations (scale effect)

**Metrics Displayed:**
```typescript
- Total Bounties: All bounties ever created

```

**Data Sources:**

### 2. AdminFeeManagement.tsx
**Location:** `src/components/admin/AdminFeeManagement.tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ Display accumulated platform fees from smart contract
- ✅ "Withdraw Fees" button with confirmation modal
- ✅ Integration with `EscrowService.withdrawFees()`

## Smart Contract Integration

### Functions Used:
1. **`owner()`** - Check if current wallet is contract owner
2. **`accumulatedFees()`** - Get total platform fees
3. **`withdrawFees()`** - Withdraw fees to owner wallet
4. **`pause()`** - Pause all contract operations
5. **`unpause()`** - Resume contract operations
6. **`paused()`** - Check if contract is paused

### EscrowService Methods:
```typescript
// Already existed:
- getContract()
- initialize(signer)
- completeBounty(bountyId, winner, solution)

// Used for new features:
- isPaused() → contract.paused()
- withdrawFees() → contract.withdrawFees()
- pause() → contract.pause()
- unpause() → contract.unpause()
```

## Database Queries

### Analytics Queries:
```sql
-- Bounty stats
SELECT status, prize_amount, bounty_type FROM bounties;

-- User count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;

-- Transaction count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payment_transactions;
```

### Fee Withdrawal History:
```sql
SELECT * FROM payment_transactions
WHERE transaction_type = 'fee_withdrawal'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### User Management:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE wallet_address ILIKE '%query%'
   OR username ILIKE '%query%'
   OR display_name ILIKE '%query%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10 OFFSET (page-1)*10;
```

## Security Features

### Access Control:
```typescript
// Step 1: Check wallet connected
if (!isConnected || !walletAddress) {
  return <WalletNotConnectedView />;
}

// Step 2: Verify contract ownership
const owner = await contract.owner();
const isOwner = owner.toLowerCase() === walletAddress.toLowerCase();

if (!isOwner) {
  return <AccessDeniedView />;
}

// Step 3: Load admin dashboard
return <AdminDashboard />;
```

### Double Confirmation for Critical Actions:
1. **Fee Withdrawal:**
   - Confirmation modal showing amount
   - Warning about gas fees
   - Explicit "Confirm Withdrawal" button

2. **Contract Pause:**
   - Red warning modal
   - List of immediate impacts
   - List of appropriate use cases
   - Explicit "Yes, Pause Contract" button

3. **Contract Unpause:**
   - Green confirmation modal
   - Description of what will resume
   - Explicit "Yes, Unpause Contract" button

### Transaction Status Tracking:
```typescript
// Pending state
const toastId = TransactionStatus.pending('Withdrawing platform fees...');

// Success state
TransactionStatus.dismiss(toastId);
TransactionStatus.success(
  txHash,
  'Successfully withdrew X HBAR in fees!',
  network
);

// Error state
TransactionStatus.error('Failed to withdraw fees');
```

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Responsive Features:
- Tab list uses flex layout (wraps on small screens)
- Stat cards: 1 column (mobile) → 2 (tablet) → 4 (desktop)
- User cards: Stack content vertically on mobile
- Search bar: Full width on mobile
- Pagination controls: Stack vertically on mobile
- Modals: Adapt to viewport width
- Fee withdrawal card: Stack button below info on mobile

### Breakpoints:
```typescript
className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4"
// Mobile: 1 column
// Tablet (sm): 2 columns
// Desktop (lg): 4 columns
```

## Performance Considerations

### Data Fetching:
- Analytics: Single load on tab open, fetches multiple tables
- Fee Management: Loads fees from contract + 10 recent withdrawals
- Emergency Controls: Single contract status check
- User Management: Paginated (10 per page), search with debounce
- Bounty Management: Reuses Phase 1 logic

### Optimization Strategies:
1. **Pagination:** Users and transactions limited to 10 per page
2. **Conditional Loading:** Analytics only fetches when tab is active
3. **Cached Contract Data:** Owner check cached until wallet changes
4. **Debounced Search:** Prevents excessive queries
5. **Selective Queries:** Only fetch required fields

### Gas Optimization:
- Fee withdrawal: Single transaction, no loops
- Pause/Unpause: Simple state change, minimal gas
- Read operations: View functions (no gas)

---

## Future Enhancements (Deferred)

### Phase 3 Candidates:
1. **Charts & Visualizations:**
   - Line chart: Bounties created over time
   - Pie chart: Bounty type distribution
   - Bar chart: Top users by earnings

2. **Advanced Filters:**
   - Date range filter for analytics
   - Bounty type filter
   - User activity filter

3. **Export Functionality:**
   - Export analytics to CSV
   - Export user list
   - Export transaction history

4. **Real-Time Updates:**
   - WebSocket for live stats
   - Auto-refresh analytics every 30s
   - Notification when fees exceed threshold

5. **Ban/Unban Users:**
   - Add is_banned field to users table
   - Ban user modal
   - Prevent banned users from creating/joining bounties

6. **Batch Operations:**
   - Batch complete multiple bounties
   - Bulk user actions

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Analytics Refresh:** Manual refresh required (no auto-update)
2. **Fee History:** Limited to 10 most recent withdrawals
3. **User Search:** Basic text matching (no advanced filters)
4. **No Charts:** Text/numbers only (no visual charts)
5. **Single Owner:** No multi-sig or role-based access
6. **No Ban Feature:** Cannot disable malicious users
