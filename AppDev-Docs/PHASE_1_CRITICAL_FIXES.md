# Phase 1: Critical Fixes & Stability

**Duration:** 1 week
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Risk Level:** Low
**Target Completion:** 85% overall

---

## üéØ Phase Objectives

Fix critical bugs and gaps that prevent production deployment. Focus on stability, error handling, and completing the bounty lifecycle automation.

## üìã Task List

### Task 1.1: Winner Selection System ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
**Priority:** P0 (Blocker)
**Estimated Time:** 3-5 days
**Dependencies:** None
**Impact:** Unblocks automated bounty completion

#### Current State
- Smart contract has `completeBounty(bountyId, winner, solution)` function
- Only contract owner can call it
- No automated way to trigger completion
- Manual intervention required

#### Implementation Options

**Option A: Admin Dashboard (Recommended for Phase 1)**
- Build simple admin panel
- Allow manual completion trigger
- Show pending bounties awaiting completion
- Verify winner before triggering

**Option B: Automated Oracle Service**
- Backend service watching bounty states
- Auto-triggers completion on first correct solution
- Requires infrastructure setup
- More complex but fully automated

**Option C: Winner Self-Claim**
- Requires smart contract modification
- Winner claims prize themselves
- Contract verifies solution
- Not recommended (needs contract redeployment)

#### Recommended Approach: Option A
Start with admin dashboard for quick deployment, plan Option B for Phase 3.
