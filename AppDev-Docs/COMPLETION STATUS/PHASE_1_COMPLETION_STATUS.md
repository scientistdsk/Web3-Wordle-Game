#### Files Modified/Created:

- ✅ `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` (MODIFIED - added admin nav item)
- ✅ `src/components/GameplayPage.tsx` (FIXED - removed auto-completion)

### Bugs Fixed (2025-10-05):

**Bug #1: Bounties Marked as Completed Prematurely**
- **Problem:** When a player completed all words, the bounty was automatically marked as "completed"
- **Root Cause:** GameplayPage.tsx was calling `handleBountyCompletion()` on player win
- **Fix:** Removed automatic bounty completion; now only admin can complete bounties
- **Files:** `src/components/GameplayPage.tsx`

**Bug #2: Participant Count Not Incrementing**
- **Problem:** CompleteBountyModal was querying wrong table name, causing 0 participants to show
- **Root Cause:** Used `participations` instead of `bounty_participants` table
- **Fix:** Changed table name to `bounty_participants` in 2 locations
- **Additional Fix:** Changed participant status from 'completed' to 'won'
- **Files:** `src/components/CompleteBountyModal.tsx`
