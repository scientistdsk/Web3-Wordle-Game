#### **tests/setup.ts** - Global Test Setup
- Mocked environment variables
- Mocked window.ethereum for wallet testing
- Mocked DOM APIs (matchMedia, IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver)
- Configured automatic cleanup after each test

#### **tests/helpers/test-helpers.ts** - Common Test Utilities

- Assertion helpers (expectTxSuccess, expectValidBounty, etc.)
- Error simulation functions

#### **tests/helpers/mock-wallet.ts** - Mock Wallet Implementation
- Full window.ethereum mock
- Transaction simulation with balance tracking
- Network switching simulation
- Event emission (accountsChanged, chainChanged, disconnect)
- State management and reset utilities
- Error simulation for edge case testing

### 2. Integration Test Suites (3 files)

#### **tests/integration/bounty-lifecycle.test.ts** (12 tests)
- ✅ Complete bounty workflow (create → join → play → complete)
- ✅ HBAR deposit and locking in escrow
- ✅ Participant joining and tracking
- ✅ Winner determination
- ✅ Prize distribution with 2.5% platform fee
- ✅ Bounty cancellation (before participants)
- ✅ Expired bounty refunds
- ✅ Edge cases: insufficient balance, invalid bounties, concurrent players
- ✅ Platform fee calculations verified

#### **tests/integration/payment-flow.test.ts** (17 tests)
- ✅ Bounty creation payment (HBAR deposit)

- ✅ Failed transaction retry logic
- ✅ Balance validation
- ✅ Prize distribution with fee deduction
- ✅ Refund processing (cancellation & expired)
- ✅ Transaction tracking in Supabase
- ✅ HBAR ↔ Wei conversion accuracy
- ✅ Error handling (network errors, contract reverts, timeouts)

#### **tests/integration/gameplay.test.ts** (15 tests)
- ✅ Word validation against dictionary (Supabase RPC)
- ✅ Invalid word rejection
- ✅ Attempt tracking in game_attempts table
- ✅ Max attempts enforcement
- ✅ Letter result calculation (correct/present/absent)
- ✅ Win/loss conditions
- ✅ Winner determination (fewest attempts, fastest time)
- ✅ Concurrent players
- ✅ Time-based bounties with limits
- ✅ Multistage bounty progression

### 3. Additional Files

#### **src/utils/supabase/types.ts** - Type Exports

## 🚀 How to Use

### Run Tests
```bash
# All tests in watch mode
pnpm test

# Integration tests only
pnpm test:integration

# With UI dashboard
pnpm test:ui

# Generate coverage report
pnpm test:coverage
```

### Example Test Usage
```typescript
import { createMockUser, createMockBounty } from './helpers/test-helpers';
import { setupMockWallet } from './helpers/mock-wallet';

describe('My Feature', () => {
  let mockWallet;

  beforeEach(() => {
    mockWallet = setupMockWallet({ balance: hbarToWei(100) });
  });

  it('should work', async () => {
    const user = createMockUser();
    const bounty = createMockBounty({ prize_amount: 5.0 });

    // Test your feature
  });
});
```
