  it('completes full bounty workflow', async () => {
    // 1. Creator creates bounty (3 HBAR)
    // 2. Verify bounty in Supabase
    // 3. Verify HBAR locked in contract
    // 4. Player joins bounty
    // 5. Player plays and wins
    // 6. Admin completes bounty
    // 7. Verify prize distributed (2.925 HBAR to winner)
    // 8. Verify platform fee (0.075 HBAR)
    // 9. Verify database updated
  });

  it('handles bounty cancellation', async () => {
    // Test cancellation before participants join
  });

  it('handles expired bounty refund', async () => {
    // Test refund after deadline

  ON bounty_participants(bounty_id, status);

CREATE INDEX idx_participants_user_status
  ON bounty_participants(user_id, status);

-- Attempts table indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_attempts_participant
  ON game_attempts(participant_id, created_at DESC);

-- Transactions table indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_user
  ON payment_transactions(user_id, created_at DESC);

CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_bounty
