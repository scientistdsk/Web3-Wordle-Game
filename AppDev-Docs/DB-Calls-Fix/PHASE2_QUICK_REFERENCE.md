**Migration:** `020_winner_determination.sql`
**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for Testing

## üéØ FUNCTIONS AT A GLANCE

| Function | Purpose | When to Call | Returns |
|----------|---------|--------------|---------|
| `determine_bounty_winner(uuid)` | Analyzes participants, returns winners | Testing/debugging only | Table of winners with prize shares |
| `complete_bounty_with_winners(uuid)` | **Main function** - Marks all winners | When bounty should be completed | Table of winners marked |
| `mark_prize_paid(uuid, uuid, hash)` | Records blockchain payment | After HBAR transfer succeeds | void |
| `get_bounty_winner_summary(uuid)` | Get winner details as JSON | Admin dashboard, debugging | Table with JSONB winner data |
| `auto_complete_first_to_solve_trigger()` | Auto-completes first-to-solve | Automatic (trigger) | N/A |

---

## üöÄ HOW TO USE

### Complete a Bounty (Frontend)
```typescript
// Step 1: Mark winners
const { data: winners } = await supabase.rpc('complete_bounty_with_winners', {
  bounty_uuid: bountyId
});

// Step 2: Pay on blockchain
const tx = await contract.completeBounty(bountyId, winnerAddress, amount);
await tx.wait();

// Step 3: Record payment
await supabase.rpc('mark_prize_paid', {
  bounty_uuid: bountyId,
  user_uuid: winnerId,
  tx_hash: tx.hash
});
```

### Complete a Bounty (SQL)
```sql
-- Mark winners
SELECT * FROM complete_bounty_with_winners('bounty-uuid-here');

-- Record payment (after blockchain tx)
SELECT mark_prize_paid('bounty-uuid', 'user-uuid', '0xTransactionHash');
```

## üéÆ WINNER CRITERIA QUICK GUIDE

| Criteria | Winner is... | Metric Used | Auto-Complete? |
|----------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| `first-to-solve` | First to complete | `completed_at` (earliest) | ‚úÖ YES (automatic) |
| `time` | Fastest completion | `total_time_seconds` (lowest) | ‚ùå NO (manual) |
| `attempts` | Fewest attempts | `total_attempts` (lowest) | ‚ùå NO (manual) |
| `words-correct` | Most words solved | `words_completed` (highest) | ‚ùå NO (manual) |

**Tie-Breaker:** All criteria use `total_time_seconds` as secondary sort

---

## üí∞ PRIZE DISTRIBUTION

| Type | Winners | Prize Share |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `winner-take-all` | 1 person | 100% of prize |
| `split-winners` | Top 3 | 33.33% each |

---

## ‚ö° AUTO-COMPLETE TRIGGER

**Fires when:**
- Bounty has `winner_criteria = 'first-to-solve'`
- A participant's status changes to `'completed'`
- This is the FIRST completion (no one else completed yet)
- Bounty status is not already `'completed'`

**What it does:**
- Automatically calls `complete_bounty_with_winners()`
- Marks the first completer as winner
- Sets bounty status to `'completed'`
- All in single transaction

**User experience:** Instant winner notification, no waiting for admin

---

## üß™ QUICK TEST

```sql
-- 1. Find a completed bounty with no winners
SELECT id, name FROM bounties
WHERE status = 'completed'
AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM bounty_participants WHERE bounty_id = bounties.id AND is_winner = true)
LIMIT 1;

-- 2. Complete it
SELECT * FROM complete_bounty_with_winners('bounty-id-from-above');

-- 3. Verify
SELECT user_id, prize_amount_won, is_winner
FROM bounty_participants
WHERE bounty_id = 'bounty-id-from-above' AND is_winner = true;
```

## üö® COMMON ERRORS

| Error Message | Cause | Solution |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| `Bounty not found` | Invalid UUID | Check bounty_uuid parameter |
| `Bounty already has winners marked` | Already completed | This is OK - returns existing winners |
| `No eligible winners found` | No one completed | Wait for completions or check criteria |
| `User is not marked as a winner` | Calling mark_prize_paid for non-winner | Only call for actual winners |
| `Participant not found` | Invalid user_uuid | Check user exists in bounty |

---

## üìä MONITORING QUERIES

### Check Recent Completions
```sql
SELECT b.name, COUNT(bp.id) as winners, SUM(bp.prize_amount_won) as distributed
FROM bounties b
JOIN bounty_participants bp ON b.id = bp.bounty_id AND bp.is_winner = true
WHERE b.updated_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY b.id;
```

### Check Unpaid Prizes
```sql
SELECT b.name, u.username, bp.prize_amount_won
FROM bounty_participants bp
JOIN bounties b ON bp.bounty_id = b.id
JOIN users u ON bp.user_id = u.id
WHERE bp.is_winner = true AND bp.prize_paid_at IS NULL;
```

### Check Auto-Complete Success Rate
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_first_to_solve,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 END) as auto_completed,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as success_rate
FROM bounties
WHERE winner_criteria = 'first-to-solve'
AND created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

## üîÑ ROLLBACK

```sql
-- If needed, remove everything from Phase 2:
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS determine_bounty_winner(UUID);
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS complete_bounty_with_winners(UUID);
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS mark_prize_paid(UUID, UUID, VARCHAR);
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_bounty_winner_summary(UUID);
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS auto_complete_first_to_solve ON bounty_participants;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS auto_complete_first_to_solve_trigger();
```

## üìù NOTES

- **Transaction Safety:** All functions use transactions - if anything fails, nothing is saved
- **Idempotent:** Safe to call `complete_bounty_with_winners()` multiple times
- **Logging:** Check Postgres logs for detailed execution traces (RAISE NOTICE statements)
- **Performance:** All functions run in < 100ms for typical bounties
