     - Winner Criteria: `time`
     - Prize Distribution: `winner-take-all`
     - Prize Amount: 5 HBAR
     - Words: ["REACT"]

   - Complete in 15 seconds (fastest!)
   - Try to solve quickly

4. **Participate as User 3**
   - Join bounty
   - Complete in 45 seconds (slowest)

5. **Complete Bounty (Admin)**
   - Go to Bounty Details page

### TEST 5: First-to-Solve Auto-Complete (Trigger Test)

**Objective:** Verify trigger marks winner automatically

**Steps:**

1. **Create Bounty**
   - Winner Criteria: `first-to-solve` ‚Üê CRITICAL!
   - Prize Distribution: `winner-take-all`
   - Prize Amount: 10 HBAR
   - Words: ["FIRST"]

2. **Participate as User 1**
   - Join bounty
   - Start playing
   - Complete the word

**Expected Results (AUTOMATIC):**

‚úÖ **Immediately after completing:**
- User 1's `is_winner` = true (check database)
- Bounty `status` = 'completed' (check database)
- No admin intervention needed!

‚úÖ **Admin verifies:**
```sql
SELECT
  b.status,
  bp.is_winner,
  bp.prize_amount_won,
  u.username
FROM bounties b
JOIN bounty_participants bp ON b.id = bp.bounty_id
JOIN users u ON bp.user_id = u.id
WHERE b.id = 'your-bounty-id';
```

Expected:
| status    | is_winner | prize_amount_won | username |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|----------|
| completed | true      | 10.00000000      | User 1   |

‚úÖ **Other users try to join:**
- Should see "Bounty is completed" or cannot join

**Note:** For first-to-solve, admin still needs to go to CompleteBountyModal to process blockchain payment. The database marking happens automatically, but HBAR transfer requires admin action.

---

### TEST 6: No Completed Participants (Error Handling)

**Objective:** Verify error handling when no one completed

**Steps:**

1. **Create Bounty**
   - Any settings

2. **Participate but DON'T complete**
   - User 1: Join but don't finish
   - User 2: Join but don't finish

3. **Try to Complete Bounty (Admin)**

**Expected Results:**

‚úÖ Modal shows: "No participants have completed this bounty yet"
‚úÖ "Complete Bounty" button is disabled
‚úÖ Cannot proceed until someone completes

---

### TEST 7: Blockchain Payment Failure

**Objective:** Test error handling when payment fails

**Steps:**

1. **Create Bounty** (any settings)

2. **Participate and complete** (any user)

3. **Simulate Payment Failure:**
   - Disconnect wallet during payment, OR
   - Use insufficient HBAR balance, OR
   - Network timeout

4. **Try to Complete Bounty**

**Expected Results:**

‚úÖ Error message appears in red box
‚úÖ Shows specific error (e.g., "Insufficient balance")
‚úÖ Database state is NOT partially updated
‚úÖ Can retry after fixing issue
‚úÖ No winners marked if payment failed

**Verify rollback:**
```sql
-- Should still be false if payment failed
SELECT is_winner, prize_amount_won
FROM bounty_participants
WHERE bounty_id = 'your-bounty-id';
```

---

### TEST 8: Payment Recording Verification

**Objective:** Verify `mark_prize_paid()` works correctly

**Steps:**

1. **Complete any bounty** (follow TEST 1)

2. **Check payment was recorded:**

```sql
SELECT
  bp.id,
  bp.is_winner,
  bp.prize_amount_won,
  bp.prize_paid_at,
  bp.prize_transaction_hash,
  u.username
FROM bounty_participants bp
JOIN users u ON bp.user_id = u.id
WHERE bp.bounty_id = 'your-bounty-id'
  AND bp.is_winner = true;
```

**Expected Results:**

‚úÖ `prize_paid_at` is NOT NULL (has timestamp)
‚úÖ `prize_transaction_hash` is NOT NULL (has 0x... hash)
‚úÖ Timestamp is recent (within last few minutes)

**Also check payment_transactions table:**

```sql
SELECT
  transaction_type,
  amount,
  currency,
  transaction_hash,
  created_at
FROM payment_transactions
WHERE bounty_id = 'your-bounty-id'
  AND transaction_type = 'prize_payout';
```

Expected: 1 row per winner with matching tx_hash

---

### TEST 9: Multiple Winners Progress Tracking

**Objective:** Verify progress UI for split-winners

**Steps:**

1. **Create split-winners bounty** (follow TEST 4)

2. **Watch modal during completion**

**Expected Progress Messages (in order):**

1. "Determining winners based on bounty criteria..."
2. "Preparing blockchain transactions..."
3. "Processing payment 1/3 to User 2..."
4. "Recording payment 1/3 details..."
5. "Processing payment 2/3 to User 1..."
6. "Recording payment 2/3 details..."
7. "Processing payment 3/3 to User 4..."
8. "Recording payment 3/3 details..."
9. "Refreshing balance..."
10. "Bounty completed successfully!"

‚úÖ Each message displays for 2-5 seconds
‚úÖ Progress indicator (spinner) shows during processing
‚úÖ No freezing or hanging
‚úÖ Total time < 60 seconds

---

### TEST 10: UI Elements Verification

**Objective:** Check all UI changes are correct

**Steps:**

1. **Open CompleteBountyModal** for any bounty

**Verify UI Elements:**

‚úÖ Info box shows:
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è Automatic Winner Selection: The system will automatically
determine the winner(s) based on the bounty's [criteria] criteria.
```

‚úÖ Bounty info shows 3 columns:
- Prize Amount
- Completed (participants)
- Winner Criteria

‚úÖ Participants list is READ-ONLY (no checkboxes/radio buttons)

‚úÖ Top participant has:
- Primary border color
- "Top Performer" badge
- Award icon

‚úÖ Button text: "Complete Bounty & Distribute Prize"

‚úÖ During processing:
- Button shows "Processing..."
- Progress indicator appears
- Cancel button disabled

‚úÖ After success:
- Button shows "Completed" with checkmark
- Success message: "Winners have been marked and prizes distributed"

---

## üêõ COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### Issue 1: "Function complete_bounty_with_winners does not exist"

**Cause:** Migration 020 not applied

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Run migration 020 in Supabase SQL Editor
```

### Issue 2: Winner marked but no HBAR received

**Cause:** Blockchain payment failed after database update

**Check:**
```sql
SELECT prize_paid_at, prize_transaction_hash
FROM bounty_participants
WHERE bounty_id = '...' AND is_winner = true;
```

If `prize_paid_at` is NULL, payment didn't happen.

**Fix:** Re-run completion or manually pay via smart contract.

### Issue 3: Modal shows no participants

**Cause:** Query filters by status = 'completed', but participants have different status

**Check:**
```sql
SELECT user_id, status
FROM bounty_participants
WHERE bounty_id = '...';
```

If status != 'completed', users haven't finished yet.

### Issue 4: Duplicate winners marked

**Cause:** Clicked "Complete Bounty" multiple times

**Prevention:** The function checks for existing winners and skips if found.

**Verify:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as winner_count
FROM bounty_participants
WHERE bounty_id = '...' AND is_winner = true;
```

Should match expected winner count (1 or 3).

## üìä VERIFICATION QUERIES

### Quick Health Check

```sql
-- Check recent bounty completions
SELECT
  b.name,
  b.winner_criteria,
  b.prize_distribution,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN bp.is_winner THEN 1 END) as winners,
  SUM(bp.prize_amount_won) as total_distributed
FROM bounties b
JOIN bounty_participants bp ON b.id = bp.bounty_id
WHERE b.status = 'completed'
  AND b.updated_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY b.id
ORDER BY b.updated_at DESC;
```

### Verify Payment Recording

```sql
-- All winners should have payment details
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_winners,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN prize_paid_at IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as paid_recorded,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN prize_transaction_hash IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as with_tx_hash
FROM bounty_participants
WHERE is_winner = true
  AND completed_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

Expected: All three counts should be equal.
