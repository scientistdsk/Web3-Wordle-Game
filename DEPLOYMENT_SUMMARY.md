## Manual Verification Instructions

Since Hedera (Chain ID 296) is not in Hardhat's default verification networks, manual verification on HashScan is required:

### Steps:

1. **Flatten the contract:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run flatten
   ```
   This creates `flattened.sol` with all imports resolved.

2. **Go to HashScan:**
   https://hashscan.io/testnet/contract/0x94525a3FC3681147363EE165684dc82140c1D6d6

3. **Click "Contract" tab â†’ "Verify Contract"**

4. **Enter verification details:**
   - **Compiler Type:** Solidity (Single file)
   - **Compiler Version:** v0.8.19+commit.7dd6d404
   - **Open Source License:** MIT
   - **Optimization:** Yes
   - **Runs:** 200
   - **Contract Code:** Paste contents of `flattened.sol`
   - **Constructor Arguments:** None (leave empty)

5. **Submit and verify**

## Next Steps

### 1. Frontend Integration âœ…
The contract is now live and the frontend is already configured:
- Contract address updated in `.env.local`
- EscrowService will connect to this address
- All payment hooks ready to use

### 2. Start Development Server
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### 3. Test Full Flow
1. **Connect Wallet** - Use Reown AppKit modal
2. **Create Bounty** - Test bounty creation with HBAR deposit
3. **Join Bounty** - Test joining as different wallet
4. **Play Game** - Test Wordle gameplay
5. **Complete Bounty** - Test prize distribution (requires owner wallet)
6. **Claim Prize** - Verify winner receives HBAR

### 4. Monitor Transactions
All transactions will be visible on HashScan:
- Bounty creation deposits
- Prize distributions
- Refunds
- Platform fee collections

### 5. Database Integration
Verify Supabase integration:
- Check `payment_transactions` table for records
- Verify `bounties` table blockchain status updates
- Confirm user participations are tracked

---

## Security Notes

### Access Control
- **Owner-only functions** protected by `onlyOwner` modifier
- **Creator-only cancellation** enforced in `cancelBounty`
- **Participant verification** required for prize claims

### Safety Features
- **Pausable:** Contract can be paused in emergency
- **Minimum bounty:** Prevents dust bounties (1 HBAR min)
- **Fee cap:** Platform fee capped at 10%
- **Reentrancy protection:** Safe external calls
- **Deadline enforcement:** Expired bounties can be refunded

### Recommended Best Practices
1. **Monitor contract balance** regularly
2. **Withdraw platform fees** periodically
3. **Keep deployer private key secure**
4. **Test all operations** on testnet before mainnet
5. **Consider multisig** for production owner role

## Environment Variables Reference

### Required in .env (deployment)
```bash
HEDERA_TESTNET_OPERATOR_ID=0.0.6871624
HEDERA_TESTNET_OPERATOR_KEY=0xd5420f524f713b1b5414b434a8985c4c149369787cae30855019b345fbeca71e

## Troubleshooting

### Contract Interactions Failing
- Verify you're on testnet (Chain ID 296)
- Check wallet has sufficient HBAR balance
- Ensure contract address is correct in `.env.local`
- Restart dev server after env changes

### Transaction Reverts
- Check error message on HashScan
- Verify function requirements (e.g., minimum bounty amount)
- Ensure caller has proper permissions
- Check bounty state (active, not completed)

### Frontend Can't Connect
- Verify Reown Project ID is valid
- Check wallet is connected to Hedera testnet
- Clear browser cache and reconnect wallet
- Check browser console for errors

---

## Production Deployment Considerations

When deploying to mainnet:

1. **Update .env with mainnet credentials:**
   ```bash
   HEDERA_MAINNET_OPERATOR_ID=0.0.xxxxx
   HEDERA_MAINNET_OPERATOR_KEY=0xabc...
   ```

2. **Deploy to mainnet:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run deploy:mainnet
   ```

3. **Update frontend .env.local:**
   ```bash
   VITE_HEDERA_NETWORK=mainnet
   VITE_ESCROW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<new_mainnet_address>
   ```

4. **Security recommendations:**
   - Transfer ownership to multisig wallet
   - Set up monitoring and alerts
   - Have emergency pause procedure ready
   - Regular security audits
